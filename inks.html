      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the CareerFoundry UX Design course, I chose to create a
        tattoo art app: Inks, a responsive web app that focus on connecting
        enthusianst with specialists.
      </p>
      <h3>What is Inks?</h3>
      <p>
        Tech & Tattoos, two words you don't hear very often used together. One
        is considered an ancient art that dates back thousands of years, while
        the other dominates everyday life we live in today. Since that tattoo
        industry has boomed into 1.65 billion dollar business in America, there
        has not been a dominant technology player to dominate this industry and
        cater to tattoo enthusiasts. The challenge is to figure out why and how
        can design help solve this problem.
      </p>
      <h3>UX Methods</h3>
      <p>
        Competitive Analysis, User Interviews, User Personas, User Journeys,
        User Flows, Site Map, Card Sorting, Wireframes, Prototypes, Usability
        Testing
      </p>
      <h3>Tools</h3>
      <p>Sketch, InVision, Balsamiq, Prott</p>
      <h3>Video</h3>
      <a href="https://youtu.be/B-6VWk11hJI">Link</a>
      <h2>1. Research</h2>
      <h3>Competitive Analysis Is anyone else doing this already?</h3>
      <p>
        Once I discovered this key takeaway, I wondered if there is another
        company providing this service. I downloaded the top 5 tattoo apps and
        came up with the following analysis. I was surprised nobody in the
        market place had a search tool that allowed you to find local artists by
        the style. Then able to schedule a meeting with the artist. Tattoodo
        came close but they did not have a location filter, even tried to
        schedule a meeting with an artist in another state but was unsuccessfu

          <h3>User Interviews Key TakeAways from the Interviews:</h3>
          <p>
            The current search process for a user to find a local tattoo artist
            that specializes in a style can be time-consuming and frustrating.
            This is because of the 2 extra steps they have to go through (2 &
            4). The first extra step is going through the tattoo studio's
            website and figure out which artist is working there as well as what
            style they specialize in. The other one would be step 4, the user
            physically going to the tattoo studio to set up a meeting or
            consultation. Having a well-designed search and scheduling app would
            cut down from 5 to 3 steps!!

        <h3>Card Sort</h3>
        <p>
          Along with my search and scheduling features. I wanted to evaluate the
          entire information architecture of my app, doing this helped me design
          which tops I can categorize together.

        <h3>Get the flow right</h3>
        <p>
          I started by using index cards then sketched out a user / task flow
          based on how the screener logic worked and when users would need to
          make decisions based on the content that was provided.

      <div>
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <h3>Low-Fidelity to Mid- Fidelity Wireframes for Search</h3>
        <p>
          Start the wireframes process with low-fidelity wireframes to
          brainstorm ideas. Then start to narrow down my ideas with mid-fidelity
          wireframes to give it more details and texts

      <div>
        <h3>Low-Fidelity to Mid- Fidelity Wireframes for Scheduling</h3>
        <p>
          Same with the scheduling feature to book artists, start with low to
          get ideas flowing. Then give it more details since there two features
          are the main focus on the app based on feedback.

        <h2>Visual</h2>
        <h3>UI Design</h3>
        <p>
          Once I tested out all usability mistakes, I started designing the
          final screens in Sketch. I wanted to make sure my design doesn't take
          away attention from the artist's work but at the same time design
          something that looked different from the industry as well. Everyone
          was using black and red, so I made my own twist to it. Followed best
          practices for accessibility and Material Design. Modern Clean Minimal
